# Source Code : Accurate Unsupervised Photon Counting from Transition Edge Sensor Signals

Code necessary to recreate all the figures in the presentation of ''Accurate Unsupervised Photon Counting from Transition Edge Sensor Signals``. The slides are created using a Markdown framework called Marp that generate a html file from standard markdown scripts.

The repository is divided in the following files :

- `Presentation.md` : Markdown file to generate the presentation.
- `Introduction.ipynb` : Plots for the introduction.
- `Methods.ipynb` : Benchmark and clustering of every technique.
- `Confidence.ipynb` : Compilation of Confidence results. 
- `Noise.ipynb` : Noise clusters using PCA and UMAP.
